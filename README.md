Clearwater Chef
========

This repository is for Chef recipes for Clearwater. It is based off of the template provided by opscode here: https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo

For instructions on how to use Chef with Clearwater, see:

* [Installing a Chef workstation](http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Installing_a_Chef_workstation.html)
* [Installing a Chef server](http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Installing_a_Chef_server.html)
* [Creating a deployment environment](http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Creating_a_deployment_environment.html)
* [Creating a deployment with Chef](http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Creating_a_deployment_with_Chef.html)

The recommended workflow is to keep all Chef configuration under version control, and to update the Chef server from
this configuration.

Updating the Chef server
========================

Knife provides commands for updating the config on the Chef server. Typically you'll be updating the following:

* Cookbooks - edit files in `cookbooks/` and upload with `knife cookbook upload <name>`
* Environments - edit files in `environments/` and upload with `knife environment from file environments/<name>.rb`
* Roles - edit files in `roles/` and upload with `knife role from file roles/<name>.rb`

For details on more knife commands check out [our documentation](https://github.com/Metaswitch/chef/blob/master/docs/knife_commands.md), run `knife --help` and consult the [chef documentation](http://docs.opscode.com/knife.html)
